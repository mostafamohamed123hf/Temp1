# WebSocket Setup for Real-Time Product Updates

This system has been enhanced to provide real-time updates when products are created, updated, or deleted from the admin panel. These updates are transmitted to all connected clients, ensuring that everyone sees the latest product information without needing to refresh the page.

## Installation Instructions

To enable real-time updates, you need to install the WebSocket package:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install the WebSocket package
npm install ws
```

## How It Works

### Backend
1. When a product is created, updated, or deleted, the backend sends a WebSocket message to all connected clients.
2. The server logs all product changes to a file at `backend/logs/product-changes.log`.

### Frontend
1. The admin page establishes a WebSocket connection to the server.
2. When a product change message is received, the admin page updates its UI automatically.
3. Users see real-time notifications when products are changed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with WebSocket connections:

1. Make sure the backend server is running.
2. Check that the WebSocket port (5000) is not blocked by a firewall.
3. Verify that the WebSocket package is installed correctly.
4. Check the browser console for any connection errors.

## Manual Fallback

If real-time updates are not working, the system will still function correctly - users will just need to refresh the page to see the latest changes.
